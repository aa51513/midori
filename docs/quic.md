# QUIC

QUIC is a morden protocol built on top of udp, which has these well known benifits:
- Fast: Only requires 1 rtt to setup. Also, `0-rtt` is supported.
- Secure: Packets are encrypted by tls1.3, which only use `AES_128_GCM_SHA256`,`AES_256_GCM_SHA384` and `CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256` as cipher suits.
- Multiplex: Multiple streams over one connection. Compared to HTTP2, there is no head-of-line blocking issue.

## position
```shell
endpoint->listen|remote->net=udp (*must*)
endpoint->listen|remote->tls (*must*)
endpoint->listen|remote->trans->quic
```

## options

### mux(client): int
max number of concurrent streams for each connection.
